# Naive Bayes Classifier

## Context
We have been selected to identify whether an email is spam or not.
The spambase dataset contains a set of word frequencies occuring in emails. 
Each email was labelled spam or not spam, denoted as 0 or 1. The spam column is turned
into a factor since we are testing binary classification.

## Experimental design

The Experimental design will include:

* Perform your EDA
* Perform any necessary feature engineering
* Check of multicollinearity
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Use different test sizes(20%, 30% & 40%)
* Compute accuracy score
* Compute MSE score
* Compute Confusion matrix score

# K-Nearest Neighbours

## Context
Titanic, in full Royal Mail Ship (RMS) Titanic, British luxury passenger liner that sank on April 14â€“15,
1912, during its maiden voyage, en route to New York City from Southampton, England, killing about 1,500 
passengers and ship personnel. One of the most famous tragedies in modern history, it inspired numerous stories, 
several films, and a musical and has been the subject of much scholarship and scientific speculation.

You are tasked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive the titanic.
Specifically you are requested to apply K-Nearest Neighbours modelling to predict which passengers 
survived the tragedy.
